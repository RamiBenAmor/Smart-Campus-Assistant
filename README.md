🧳 PART 2: Lost-and-Found Assistant
An intelligent assistant designed to streamline the process of reporting and recovering lost or found items on campus.

🎯 Objective
To simplify the declaration and search for lost items through a conversational interface and smart matching system.

💬 User Interface
Input field: for users to type their messages to the chatbot.

Two main buttons:

🔍 LOST – to report a lost item.

🧾 FOUND – to report a found item.

⚙️ How It Works
Reporting:

If you have lost an item, describe it in as much detail as possible.

If you have found an item, also provide a detailed description.

Smart Matching:

The chatbot automatically compares entered descriptions.

If a match is detected, it will display the phone number of the relevant person so you can contact them directly.

🔁 Interaction Modes
This module, like the Navigation and Inquiry Bot, works with exclusive usage modes:

The user activates a mode (LOST or FOUND) by clicking one of the buttons.

The selected mode remains highlighted until another one is chosen.

This system ensures clear and focused interactions.
